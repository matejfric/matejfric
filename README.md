### Hi there 👋

- 🌲 I’m currently working on data science and computer vision projects at Stora Enso.
- 🔬 I'm also researching bayesian models for corrosion detection at VSB-TUO.
- 🏫 I hold a bachelor's degree in Computational and Applied Mathematics from VSB-TUO. I have written my bachelor's thesis on the topic of [Scalable Probabilistic Method in Applications](https://github.com/matejfric/SPAMethodInApplications).
